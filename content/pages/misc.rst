More about me on CS
===================

I fall in love with computer since kindergarden when I first played a RPG game in it.

Now, I am a **GNU/Linux** user and a believer in **freesoftware** (Also known as opensource, but not exactly the same thing as RMS would say). 

I use freesoftwares to complete nearly all my daily works and contribute back as much as I can. I do so not only because freesoftware sounds morally right but also because using freesoftwares can greatly increase my work effecience. Moreover, I can always learn a lot and meet many interesting people when participating in freesoftware projects.

Interests outside cyberspace
================================================

 - When I have time, I will go to **soccer** field and have a nice game. Or if I am busy, **Taichi** will be another way for me to exercise. In a word, I cannot live without sport! :-)

 - Playing **guitar** is one of my favorite ways for relaxing, though I am just a beginner and sometimes it turns into a torture to my room mates. Sorry dudes.

 - I **paint** in my spare time, part of my works can be found here__.

 - Besides all the above, I love **travel** and hiking. It's great to meet all kinds of people during the trip.
